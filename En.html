                <h3>2022 Al-Fajr Al-Sadiq/Unity Squares</h3>
                <p>On Friday, August 5, 2022, Israel assassinated the commander of the northern region of the al-Quds Brigades (the military arm of the Islamic Jihad Movement) in Gaza, by targeting him with a drone inside a residential apartment in the "Palestine Tower" in the Rimal neighborhood.</p>
                <p>The assassination came in light of efforts exerted by Egypt to prevent the deterioration of the situation, following Israel's arrest of a prominent leader in the Islamic Jihad movement in Jenin in the West Bank, Bassam al-Saadi.</p>
                <p>Israel called this operation the "Sincere Dawn", and justified the choice of that name as "to confirm its focus on the jihad movement, which takes the color black as a slogan," according to a statement by the occupation army.</p>
                <p>The Islamic Jihad Movement responded with an operation called "United Squares", during which it fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli towns and cities, and said in a statement that it was a joint operation with the National Resistance Brigades, the Mujahideen Brigades and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades (the military wing of Fatah).</p>
                <p>The Al-Quds Brigades said in a statement that it had bombed Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion Airport, Ashdod, Beersheba, Ashkelon, Netivot and Sderot.</p>
                <p>The Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip reported that the number of martyrs in this war reached 24, including 6 children, while 203 were injured, since the beginning of the Israeli raids on Gaza.</p>
